### STEP 4: Create the optimal player based on relevant predictors


#remove observations if G+A is smaller than 13
merged_data <- merged_data %>% filter(`G+A` >= 13)

# Proceed with the pre-processing and k-NN steps
preprocess_model <- preProcess(merged_data %>%

# Scale the Full Dataset

# Create Optimal Player Profile Using 80th Percentile Values

)

# Rename columns in optimal_player to match preprocess_model exactly

# Apply the preprocessing model to scale the optimal player profile
optimal_player_scaled <- predict(preprocess_model, newdata = optimal_player)

###--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 5: Finding closest player to optimal player profile 

library(FNN)

# SCALE data for NN
big5_player_knn_scaled <- big5_scaled %>% select(`Att Pen_Touches`, Live_Touches,`Att 3rd_Touches`, 
                                                 SoT_per_90_Standard, Min_Playing)

                                                              SoT_per_90_Standard, Min_Playing)

k <- 30
big5_player_knn_scaled <- na.omit(big5_player_knn_scaled)
optimal_player_knn_scaled <- na.omit(optimal_player_knn_scaled)

# Run the k-NN function
nearest_neighbors <- get.knnx(data = big5_player_knn_scaled, query = optimal_player_knn_scaled, k = k)

closest_players_indices <- nearest_neighbors$nn.index

# Retrieve closest players from merged_data, which has the G+A filter applied
closest_players <- merged_data[closest_players_indices, ]

# Only view Player, exPts_dummy and G+A and squad

closest_players <- closest_players %>% select(Player, exPts_dummy, `G+A`, Squad, Comp, Age)
closest_players

#remove players over 26
closest_players <- closest_players %>% filter(Age <= 26)
closest_players
